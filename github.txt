Group Purchasing
Group purchasing is a process that allows several individuals or businesses to come together for the 
purpose of purchasing various types of goods and services at discounted rates.
Why Group Purchasing?
 Normally, companies pay less per unit when buying more units.
 Electronic aggregators find individuals or small/medium enterprises who want to buy the 
same product, aggregate their small orders and then negotiate for the best deal.
E-Marketplace
An E-marketplace is an internet location owned by a company or consortium which allows other 
companies or individuals to get new suppliers or buyers for their products. 
Most of the e-marketplaces provide two basic functions: 1) they allow companies to obtain new 
suppliers or buyers for company products, or 2) developing streamlined trading networks that make 
negotiating, settlement, and delivery more efficient.
Main Components:
 Front end: The section of e-seller’s business processes through which customers interact 
(includes electronic catalogs, shopping cart, sellers portal, payment gateway, etc.)
 Back end: The activities that support online order taking (includes inventory management, raw 
material purchasing, payment processing, delivery)
